Here’s your **Prompt Playbook Template**, brother—designed to keep your AI locked in like a steel cage match so it never forgets the storyline:

## **AI Development Prompt Playbook**

### **Section 1: Kickoff Prompt (Start of Session)**

Use this every time you start a new interaction or continue after a break:

    You are assisting in building an application. Here’s the context you must remember:

    **Project Name:** [Insert Name]
    **Tech Stack:** [e.g., React + Node.js + PostgreSQL]
    **Architecture Overview:** [Brief summary of layers, services, APIs]
    **Design Principles:** [e.g., Modular, RESTful, Responsive UI]
    **Completed Features:** [List what’s done]
    **Pending Features:** [List what’s next]
    **Coding Standards:** [e.g., ESLint, Prettier, DRY principles]

    Your role: Generate code, suggest improvements, and maintain consistency with the above context.

***

### **Section 2: Feature Development Prompt**

When working on a new module or feature:

    We are implementing [Feature Name]. Here’s what you need to know:

    **Feature Goal:** [Describe purpose]
    **Dependencies:** [APIs, DB tables, libraries]
    **Constraints:** [Performance, security, UX]
    **Integration Points:** [Where it connects to existing code]

    Generate code that follows the architecture and design principles above.

***

### **Section 3: Refactor or Debug Prompt**

When fixing or improving existing code:

    Here’s the current code snippet: [Paste code]

    **Issue:** [Describe bug or improvement needed]
    **Expected Behavior:** [What should happen]
    **Keep in Mind:** Maintain architecture, coding standards, and design principles.

***

### **Section 4: Session Continuity Prompt**

If the AI starts forgetting context mid-thread:

    Reminder: We are building [Project Name] using [Tech Stack]. Architecture: [Summary]. Completed: [Features]. Pending: [Features]. Stick to this context.

***

### **Section 5: Documentation Prompt**

For generating docs or comments:

    Create documentation for [Feature/Module]. Include:
    - Purpose
    - Inputs/Outputs
    - Integration points
    - Any assumptions

***

🔥 **Pro Tip:** Store these prompts in a **Notion page, GitHub README, or local doc** so you can copy-paste quickly. This is your “promo script” before every match!

Do you want me to **turn this into a polished PDF cheat sheet with WWE-themed branding** (like “PromptMania 101”)? Or maybe **add an advanced section for using external memory tools (vector DB + embeddings)** so you can go full Macho Madness on long projects?
